ARKOA - ActiveRules on Koa
==========================

ActiveRules on Koa 
A powerful framework for creating the next generation of peer-to-peer, social and interactive web sites.
With ActiveRules `Zero Code API` you simply define your business objects and the rules for how they interact and the API endpoints are auto-generated.

## Data Models
* Data objects are stored in JSON
* Objects have a defined JSON Schema
* All data can be validated against its schema
* Schema validation errors are handled in a consistent manner
* No validation should happen at the DB library level. (i.e. Mongoose validation)
* JSON object are converted to JavaScript objects for processing.
* The JavaScript objects properties and methods are defined within the schema
